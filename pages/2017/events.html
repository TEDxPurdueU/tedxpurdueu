      <h2>TEDxPurdueU: UnscripTED</h2>
      <p class="sub">March 25, 1 PM - 5 PM @ Loeb Playhouse</p>
      <p>Life is not prescribed, and our stories are written as much by the serendipitous accidents that shape our every day as the events we anticipate a mile away. Our main event of the season celebrates those among us who live and work as they improvise with determination and wander with a dream, those who live for the North Star but make of every ordinary day an accidental, deliberate step towards tomorrow â€“ unfazed, unafraid, <b>unscripTED</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/purdue/EN/buy/details/TEDX">Join us</a> for an afternoon with an amazing panel of speakers! Come find new ideas, meet your next inspiration, and connect with other attendees on campus.</p>

      <h2>TEDxPurdueUSalon: Back to the Future</h2>
      <p class="sub">November 9, 6:30 PM - 7:30 PM @ Class of 1950 Lecture Hall</p>
      <p>Our second Salon event of the 2016-17 season featured talks on our lives in the future, and living for that future, for sustainability. Everything from breakthroughs in farming technologies to <i>Minority Report</i>-style experiences that we'll find in our daily lives in just a few decades, we saw glimpses of our future in the world around us.</p>
