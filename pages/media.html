      <h1>Media and Press</h1>

      <p>All press requests should be sent to the TEDxPurdueU Organizers (TEDxPurdueU@gmail.com) and addressed to Joseph Louis, the official spokesperson for TEDxPurdueU. Please note that TEDxPurdueU event organizers are not able to speak for the TED Conference as a whole. Any inquiry regarding TED should be sent to:</p>

      <p><b>Melody Sarafino</b> <br>
      TEDx Media Liaison <br>
      TEDxPR@groupsjr.com</p>

      <p>We kindly ask that journalists be respectful of the difference between the TED and TEDx brands. The ‘x’ in ‘TEDx’ stands for “independently organized events.” Any headline or text which implies “TED” is coming to Purdue University is misleading, as TED refers to the annual TED conference in Long Beach, CA. For more information on TEDx, visit <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx">TED's official page about TEDx events</a>.</p>
