      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>TEDxPurdueU strives to nurture a culture of innovation by sharing state of the art ideas developed by Purdue students, faculty and alumni with the global TED community. Our first event, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIwWUZeSdWq0Fl4GiD0Zr3kQEE3vE9mOY" target="_blank">“Innovation”</a>, was held on March 22, 2012 in Fowler Hall. In 2013, we grew in size and scope, presenting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XznzWRXLjHs&list=PLIwWUZeSdWq14R-dg_ZyMyL5iN2lkVxGB" target="_blank">“Past Present Progress”</a> in Loeb Playhouse. 2014’s event, worked on the theme of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XznzWRXLjHs&list=PLIwWUZeSdWq14R-dg_ZyMyL5iN2lkVxGB" target="_blank">“Daring Greatly“</a>. In 2015, we presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M20Oc_4m-Ew&list=PLIwWUZeSdWq2mCqqqD1HK8cBYHkjsKtkW" target="_blank">“Meraki”</a>, a modern Greek which means “doing something with soul, creativity, love; putting a piece of yourself in your work.”</p>

      <p>In 2016, our fifth year of sharing ideas was “Tear Up The Box”, filling Loeb Playhouse with three sessions, and our 2017 event, "unscripTED", showcased stories of how creativity and improvisational thinking led to success and movements that matter.</p>

      <p>Our next event is scheduled for Saturday, March 3, 2018, at Purdue's Loeb Playhouse.</p>

      <h2>About TEDxPurdueUSalon</h2>

      <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

      <h2>About TED</h2>

      <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

      <p>TED’s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.</p>

      <p>TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>
