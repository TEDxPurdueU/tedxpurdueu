      <h2>TEDxPurdueU: Art of the Ordinary</h2>
      <p class="sub">March 3, 1PM - 5PM @ Loeb Playhouse</p>
      <p>In the world of content with supercuts and highlights, we often ignore the moments that make our life – the ordinary ones. These ordinary moments slowly crank our engines, shape our character, prepare us for challenges and brings balance from instances of abundances or scarcity. For this year’s flagship event, <b>Art of the Ordinary</b>, we invite you to appreciate and savor the little ordinary things around us with our eclectic group of speakers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/purdue/EN/buy/details/TEDXPU">Join us</a> for an afternoon with an unmatched panel of speakers and entertainers! Come get inspired, find new ideas, and enjoy a day with other TEDxPurdueU attendees from the campus and community.</p>

      <h2>TEDxPurdueUSalon: Sense Your Creativity</h2>
      <p class="sub">November 30, 6PM - 7PM @ WALC</p>
      <p>"Creativity is a way of living life that embraces originality and makes unique connections between seemingly disparate ideas. We often think about creativity as making something, but in fact the root meaning of the word means ‘to grow’."</p>
      <p>Our second salon event of the season celebrates the diversity and unifying force that is our inner creativity, from music to the visual arts to poetry to writing.</p>

      <h2>TEDxPurdueUSalon: Beyond Your Boundaries</h2>
      <p class="sub">October 19, 7pm - 8PM @ WALC</p>
