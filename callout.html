      <h1>Callout!</h1>

      <p>TEDxPurdueU's callout for the 2016-17 season will be August 31 (Wed), 7:45 - 8:45 PM.</p>

      <h2>What is it?</h2>

      <p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxPurdueU, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxPurdueU event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

      <p>Come to our Fall callout to connect with other TED talk enthusiasts and share your ideas with the TED community. Now is the time to join the TEDxPurdueU team, with opportunities in the following committees: Speakers, Marketing, Sponsors, and Events. We have some really exciting events and opportunities coming your way, so mark your calendar and invite your friends!</p>

      <p>Food will be provided!</p>
