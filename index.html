      <p>This year, we're celebrating those among us who live and work as they improvise with determination and wander with a dream, those who live for the North Star but make of every ordinary day an accidental, deliberate step towards tomorrow â€“ unfazed, unafraid, <b>unscripTED</b>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/purdue/EN/buy/details/TEDX">Join us</a> for an afternoon with an amazing panel of speakers! Come find new ideas, meet your next inspiration, and connect with other attendees on campus.</p>
