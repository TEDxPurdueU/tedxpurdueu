      <h1>Main Event: Art of the Ordinary</h1>
      
      <p>We often imagine people who make a dent in history to be heroes,geniuses... almost superhuman. We celebrate and admire the
        stories of the seemingly exceptional. But it is not geniuses and legends that truly move the world forward. It is thousands
        of ordinary people who fail, fail and fail again until success is no longer a distant dream.</p>
      <p>Not everyone who stands on a stage to tell their story is born with otherworldly talents, but every one of them has mastered
        the art of persistently and relentlessly striving to do something they are passionate about. We, at TEDxPurdueU, would
        like to pay a humble tribute to the spirit of perseverance and grit that often gets understated in these extraordinary
        stories — what we’d like to call the Art of the Ordinary.</p>
      <p><i>TEDxPurdueU: Art of the Ordinary</i> is happening soon on <b>March 5</b> at Purdue's <b>Loeb Playhouse</b>! Reserve your spot by getting tickets at <a href="/tickets">tedxpurdueu.com/tickets</a>.</p>
