      <h1>Program</h1>

      <p>Not everyone who stands on a stage to tell their story is born with otherworldly talents, but every one of them has mastered the art of persistently and relentlessly striving to do something they are passionate about. We, at TEDxPurdueU, would like to pay tribute to the spirit of perseverance, persistence, and grit that often gets understated in these extraordinary stories — what we’d like to call the <b>Art of the Ordinary</b>.</p>
