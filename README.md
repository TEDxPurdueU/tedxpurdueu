# Technologies

Because our web application hosts mostly static content, until such time as we need more dynamic data interactions, we're using static pages for the main site at `tedxpurdueu.com` and serving static JSON through node at the API endpoints for mobile applications.



# Server administration

Both our static web server and our JSON (mobile application backend) server are hosted on a Fedora server on DigitalOcean
